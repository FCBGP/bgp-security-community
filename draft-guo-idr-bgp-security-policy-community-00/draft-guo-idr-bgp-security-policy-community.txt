       Using BGP Community for Inter-AS Security Policy Signaling
           draft-guo-idr-bgp-security-policy-community-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a set of standardized BGP communities to
   signal inter-AS routing security policy intent.  Current mechanisms
   such as ROA [RFC6482] [RFC9582] and ASPA [ASPA-Profile]
   [ASPA-Verification] provide validation outcomes, but leave "NotFound"
   or "Unknown" states operationally ambiguous.

   This document defines transitive communities that allow an Origin AS
   to explicitly express its security policy expectations, such as a
   preference for strict handling of ROA or ASPA validation ambiguity,
   to downstream Autonomous Systems (AS).  Unlike validation states,
   these communities do not assert correctness or authorization.
   Instead, they communicate origin-declared policy intent to all
   downstream ASes, enabling them to correlate this intent with locally
   derived validation results.  By enabling explicit signaling of
   security expectations without exporting validation state, this
   mechanism allows downstream ASes to make more informed policy
   decisions while reducing the risk of accidental outages caused by
   misinterpretation of ambiguous validation outcomes.

   This mechanism is orthogonal to existing routing security validation
   technologies and does not alter their semantics or deployment models.

1.  Introduction

   Inter-domain routing security mechanisms intentionally separate
   validation from policy.  While this separation improves robustness,
   it also creates persistent operational ambiguity.

   Internet routing security relies on distributed validation mechanisms
   like RPKI [RFC6480], ROA [RFC6482] [RFC9582], and ASPA [ASPA-Profile]
   [ASPA-Verification].  However, there is a functional gap between
   "knowing a route's validity" and "knowing the origin's policy
   intent."

   These security mechanisms are often locally enforced only.  No
   consistent method exists for an AS to signal its security
   requirements or expectations for propagated prefixes.
   [AVOID-RPKI-STATE-IN-BGP] advises against carrying actual RPKI-
   derived validation state in BGP, in particular using transitive
   attributes such as BGP Communities.  This is an important safeguard,
   but it leaves downstream ASes with ambiguity.  For example, when a
   Transit AS observes an RPKI "NotFound" state, it cannot distinguish
   between an Origin AS that has not deployed RPKI and an Origin AS that
   has deployed RPKI but suffered a configuration error or a hijack
   attempt.  These mechanisms do not allow an Origin AS to express:

   *  whether it expects strict handling to be applied to ambiguous
      validation outcomes;

   *  whether certain propagation behaviors are explicitly expected or
      operationally acceptable;

   *  and whether "NotFound" or "Unknown" outcomes are operationally
      acceptable.

   As a result, downstream networks frequently face situations where
   routing information is technically acceptable, yet operationally
   unexpected.  In large-scale deployments, this ambiguity leads to:

   *  inconsistent treatment of identical prefixes;

   *  reliance on bilateral or undocumented conventions;

   *  and difficulty distinguishing misconfiguration from malicious
      behavior.

   Existing uses of BGP communities partially address this gap, but lack
   standardized semantics and a clear separation from validation state.

   By signaling security policy intent, an Origin AS can explicitly
   inform the network of its operational expectations regarding routing
   security.  For example, an Origin AS may indicate that it prefers
   downstream ASes to apply stricter handling for its prefixes when
   local validation results are ambiguous.

   This signaling enables downstream ASes to distinguish between
   intentional non-deployment and unexpected validation outcomes, and to
   apply locally appropriate policy decisions without exporting or
   redefining validation state.  The mechanism defined in this document
   is explicitly designed to follow the guidance in
   [AVOID-RPKI-STATE-IN-BGP] by avoiding the carriage of RPKI-derived
   validation state in BGP.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Strict:
      In this document, the term "Strict" as used in community names
      (e.g., "ROA-Strict") refers solely to the Origin AS's stated
      policy preference regarding the handling of ambiguous validation
      outcomes.  It does not imply any mandated filtering, dropping, or
      preference change by downstream ASes, and it MUST NOT be
      interpreted as a remote instruction to suppress routes.

   Security Policy Community:
      A BGP Community or Large Community defined by this document to
      convey origin-declared routing security policy intent.

   Validation State:
      A locally derived outcome of a security validation mechanism, such
      as RPKI Prefix Origin Validation or ASPA-based path validation
      (e.g., "Valid", "Invalid", "NotFound", "Unknown").  Validation
      state is explicitly out of scope for the communities defined in
      this document.

3.  Policy Signaling and Transitivity

3.1.  Transitive Property Requirement

   All communities defined in this document are specified as transitive,
   with the intent that the origin-declared policy can be observed by
   all ASes along the AS-PATH.

   Intermediate ASes may apply local policy that removes or modifies
   communities; such behavior is outside the scope of this
   specification.  This specification does not impose any requirement on
   intermediate ASes to preserve these communities.  Preservation is an
   operational choice intended to maximize the visibility of origin-
   declared policy intent.

3.2.  Policy Signaling Versus Validation State

   This document makes a strict distinction between:

   *  validation state, which is derived locally from cryptographic or
      registry-based mechanisms; and

   *  policy intent, which reflects the Origin AS's operational
      expectations.

   The communities defined herein exclusively signal policy intent.
   They do not encode validation outcomes, confidence levels, or
   security posture of any AS other than the origin.

   Downstream ASes MUST NOT interpret these communities as an indication
   that validation has been successfully performed, nor as a substitute
   for local validation.

   Implementations and Operators MUST NOT configure policies that set,
   clear, or modify the Security Policy Communities defined in this
   document based solely on per-route validation outcomes (for example,
   "if validation is Valid, then attach ROA-Strict").  Doing so would
   effectively re-export validation state in BGP Communities, contrary
   to the guidance in [AVOID-RPKI-STATE-IN-BGP].

   This design explicitly aligns with the guidance in
   [AVOID-RPKI-STATE-IN-BGP], and avoids propagating dynamic security
   state within BGP.

4.  Protocol Operations

4.1.  Architecture Overview

   The mechanism defined in this document operates entirely within the
   BGP control plane and does not alter protocol message formats or path
   selection procedures.

   An Origin AS attaches one or more Security Policy Communities when
   originating a route.  These communities are propagated unchanged
   unless explicitly removed or modified by policy.

   Intermediate and receiving ASes may choose to:

   *  ignore the communities;

   *  log or monitor their presence;

   *  correlate them with local validation results;

   *  and incorporate them into local policy decisions.

   No mandatory processing behavior is defined, and no interoperability
   dependency is introduced.

4.2.  Origin AS Behavior

   An Origin AS that chooses to signal security policy intent SHALL
   attach the appropriate Security Policy Community when originating a
   route.  It MUST ensure that its published RPKI ROAs and ASPA objects
   are consistent with the signaled community to avoid self-inflicted
   DoS.

   For example, an AS 65001 that wishes to indicate a strict policy
   posture with respect to ROA-based validation ambiguity for a given
   prefix may attach the following Large Community:

   *  65001:1000:1 (ROA-Strict, default strict posture)

   An Origin AS MUST NOT attach the Security Policy Communities defined
   in this document as a function of per-route validation outcomes
   (e.g., "attach ROA-Strict only when a particular route is currently
   Valid").  Instead, the communities are intended to describe a
   relatively stable per-origin policy posture.

4.3.  Intermediate AS Behavior

   A receiving AS that chooses to process these communities MUST verify
   that the Global Administrator ASN in the Large Community matches the
   rightmost (Origin) AS in the AS_PATH.  If they do not match, the
   community MUST be ignored to prevent unauthorized policy signaling.

   If this check succeeds, a receiving AS MAY correlate the presence of
   ROA-Strict or ASPA-Strict communities with its locally derived
   validation results as part of its local policy framework.

   For example, a local policy may treat a route carrying a ROA-Strict
   community as less acceptable when the local RPKI validation state is
   NotFound.  Such behavior is illustrative only and is not mandated by
   this specification.

4.4.  Applicability to Route Leak and Hijack Detection

   Security policy communities may serve as additional context for
   routing analysis systems.

   For example, a route that violates an origin-authorized export
   constraint, while also exhibiting abnormal AS path patterns, may be
   flagged as anomalous with higher confidence when it also carries a
   strict policy community.

   Such signals can reduce false positives in detection systems by
   providing operator-declared intent, without asserting correctness.
   This document does not define detection algorithms or mitigation
   procedures.

4.5.  Deployment Considerations

   The proposed mechanism is compatible with existing routing policies
   and does not require changes to BGP implementations.  Deployment of
   this mechanism is expected to be incremental and partial.

   The proposed mechanism is intended for gradual deployment and
   interoperability with existing BGP technologies.  Origin ASes may
   selectively signal policy intent for specific prefixes.  In hybrid
   networks where both supporting and non-supporting ASes are present,
   policy communities will simply be ignored by legacy BGP speakers,
   providing backward compatibility.  No coordination between ASes is
   required.

   For environments supporting both Standard [RFC1997] and Large
   [RFC8092] Communities, implementations SHOULD attach both
   representations to maximize backward compatibility.  Operators are
   encouraged to monitor for loss or modification of policy communities
   due to intermediate ASes that filter or rewrite BGP Community
   attributes, so as to ensure policy expectations are properly signaled
   end-to-end.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a policy signaling mechanism using BGP
   communities.  It does not define a security mechanism and does not
   provide independent security guarantees.  It is not intended for
   real-time attack mitigation or automated incident response.

   This document follows the guidance in [AVOID-RPKI-STATE-IN-BGP] by
   not carrying any RPKI-derived validation state in BGP.  The
   communities defined here do not encode or imply specific validation
   outcomes (such as Valid, Invalid, or NotFound).  Instead, they allow
   an Origin AS to express a relatively stable policy posture regarding
   how downstream ASes may treat ambiguous validation results, if they
   choose to do so.

5.1.  Authenticity and Integrity

   The communities defined in this document are not cryptographically
   protected and may be modified, removed, or added in transit.  This is
   consistent with existing BGP community usage and with the design
   goals of this document.

   No attempt is made to ensure integrity or authenticity of community
   propagation.  Accordingly, these communities MUST NOT be treated as
   authoritative security assertions and MUST NOT be used as a basis for
   accepting otherwise invalid routes.

   The semantics defined herein apply only to communities that are
   plausibly originated by the Origin AS, as determined by the Global
   Administrator field matching the rightmost AS in the AS_PATH.  This
   check is intended solely to limit semantic impersonation and does not
   constitute a security guarantee.

   An adversary capable of hijacking a route may also attach, modify, or
   remove communities.

5.2.  Relationship to Validation Mechanisms

   The communities defined in this document do not represent validation
   results, security states, or assertions of route correctness,
   legitimacy, or authorization.

   In particular, the presence or absence of a Security Policy Community
   MUST NOT be interpreted as indicating whether a route is valid or
   invalid under RPKI, ASPA, BGPsec, or any other validation mechanism.

   These communities MUST NOT override locally derived validation
   results, including a "Valid" RPKI state.  They may be correlated with
   validation outcomes as part of local policy or analysis, but they do
   not alter the semantics of those outcomes.

   Implementations and Operators MUST NOT use these communities as a
   reason to skip or short-circuit local validation.

5.3.  Policy Semantics and Downstream Behavior

   The communities defined in this document express origin-authorized
   policy intent only.  They do not define required actions.

   Downstream Autonomous Systems MAY ignore these communities entirely
   without violating this specification.  Any routing, filtering, or
   preference decisions remain solely a matter of local policy.

   The absence of a policy community MUST NOT be interpreted as
   expressing the opposite intent.

   This document does not require or expect consistent interpretation or
   uniform behavior across Autonomous Systems.  Differences in
   interpretation, deployment, and operational use are expected and
   acceptable.

5.4.  Denial-of-Service and Abuse Considerations

   This document intentionally avoids defining communities that directly
   request route suppression or traffic dropping.  As a result, it
   reduces the risk that a malicious actor could trigger network-wide
   disruption through abuse of policy signaling.

   Nevertheless, operators should be aware that misconfiguration or
   abuse of these communities may influence local policy decisions if
   such decisions are explicitly configured to consider them.  Operators
   are encouraged to avoid automated hard actions based solely on the
   presence of these communities, and to combine them with independently
   derived validation results and operational context.

5.5.  Threat Model Summary

   Potential abuse scenarios include, but are not limited to:

   *  false or misleading signaling of policy intent;

   *  removal or modification of policy signals during propagation;

   *  inconsistent signaling across multiple origin points.

   These risks are inherent to existing uses of BGP communities and do
   not introduce new attack vectors.  Operators SHOULD correlate these
   signals with independently verifiable information when making
   security-related decisions.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Large Community Mapping

   This document defines new BGP Community values for signaling security
   policy intent.  Compared to Extended Communities, Large Communities
   are used to avoid ASN exhaustion and ambiguity associated with 16-bit
   Global Administrator fields.

   IANA is requested to create a sub-registry "BGP Security Policy
   Action IDs" under the "BGP Large Communities" registry.

   The format of these communities are "Global-Administrator:Action-
   ID:Parameter".  The Global Administrator MUST be the ASN of the
   Origin AS.

   The "Strict" qualifier expresses only an origin-declared preference
   and does not define any required downstream behavior.

  Action ID | Name        | Policy Intent Description
  ---------------------------------------------------
  1000      | ROA-Strict  | Origin expresses a preference for strict handling of
            |             | routes when RPKI validation results are Invalid or
            |             | NotFound.
  1001      | ASPA-Strict | Origin expresses a preference for strict handling of
            |             | routes when ASPA validation results are Invalid or
            |             | Unknown.

6.2.  Standard Community Mapping

   This mapping is provided solely to facilitate incremental deployment
   in networks that do not yet support BGP Large Communities.

   For [RFC1997] support, the following values are assigned from the
   Well-Known range:

   *  "65535:1000" (ROA-Strict)

   *  "65535:1001" (ASPA-Strict)

   Operators MUST understand that these Standard Communities cannot
   encode the Origin AS in the Global Administrator field, and therefore
   lack the plausibility check described for Large Communities.  Their
   semantics remain the same, but they are more susceptible to
   impersonation and SHOULD be used with care.

Appendix A.  Parameter Field Extensibility

   The "Parameter" field in the BGP Security Policy Community is
   explicitly designed for extensibility.  Currently, a value of "1"
   conveys default strict enforcement for security actions (e.g., ROA-
   Strict or ASPA-Strict).  Future assignments may introduce further
   parameters to support nuanced policy signaling, such as variant
   handling levels, time-limited policies, or security requirements
   specific to more recent routing security enhancements.

   Example encodings:

   *  "65001:1000:1" (ROA-Strict, default strict enforcement)

   *  "65001:1000:2" (ROA-Strict, but only for prefixes with maxLength
      constraints, a future possible assignment)

   *  "65001:1002:1" (hypothetical new Action-ID for a future policy,
      e.g., "AS-Cones Strict")

   The Action-ID and Parameter range is managed through IANA for orderly
   growth as the community adopts richer security policies.

   The extensibility of the Parameter field is intentionally limited to
   policy refinement and does not introduce conditional logic or dynamic
   state signaling.

Appendix B.  Relationship to Existing Mechanisms

   This section clarifies the relationship between the mechanism defined
   in this document and existing routing policy, traffic engineering,
   and routing security mechanisms.  The goal is to explicitly delineate
   scope and avoid overlap or semantic ambiguity.

B.1.  Relationship to RPKI, ROA, and ASPA

   RPKI-based mechanisms such as ROA and ASPA provide cryptographic or
   registry-backed validation outcomes for routing information.  These
   mechanisms answer the question of whether a route is consistent with
   registered authorization data.

   The communities defined in this document do not provide validation
   and do not alter validation outcomes.  They do not indicate that a
   route is valid, invalid, or authorized.  Instead, they allow an
   Origin AS to express its operational expectations regarding how
   ambiguous validation outcomes (e.g., NotFound or Unknown) may be
   handled by downstream ASes.

   This mechanism is therefore complementary to RPKI and ASPA.  It
   operates strictly at the policy signaling layer and does not export
   validation state, consistent with the guidance in
   [AVOID-RPKI-STATE-IN-BGP].

B.2.  Relationship to BGPsec

   BGPsec [RFC8205] provides cryptographic protection of the AS_PATH to
   ensure path integrity and origin authentication.  BGPsec is designed
   to assert and verify routing correctness.

   The mechanism defined in this document does not provide cryptographic
   protection, path validation, or origin authentication.  It does not
   attempt to replace or replicate BGPsec functionality.  Instead, it
   provides an optional policy signal that may be used in conjunction
   with BGPsec or in environments where BGPsec is not deployed.

B.3.  Relationship to BGP Color and Color-Aware Routing

   BGP Color and Color-Aware Routing mechanisms are primarily intended
   to support traffic engineering and transport-specific constraints,
   such as latency, bandwidth, or SR policy selection.

   While both mechanisms use BGP communities as signaling vehicles, the
   semantics are fundamentally different.  BGP Color expresses
   forwarding or transport preferences, whereas the communities defined
   in this document express origin-declared routing security policy
   intent.

   This document does not define path selection behavior, traffic
   steering, or forwarding constraints, and does not overlap with the
   objectives of Color-Aware Routing.

B.4.  Relationship to Only-To-Customer (OTC)

   OTC [RFC9234] is a mechanism designed to assist in route leak
   prevention by signaling export intent at AS boundaries.

   The communities defined in this document differ from OTC in scope and
   semantics.  OTC signals propagation constraints related to business
   relationships, whereas this document signals security policy
   expectations related to validation ambiguity.

   These mechanisms are complementary and may coexist on the same
   routes.  Neither mechanism subsumes the other.

B.5.  Summary of Scope Separation

   In summary:

   *  This document does not export validation state;

   *  this document does not assert routing correctness or
      authorization;

   *  this document does not define forwarding or traffic engineering
      behavior;

   *  this document does not mandate filtering or rejection behavior.

   The mechanism is limited to expressing origin-declared security
   policy intent and is designed to coexist with existing routing
   security and policy mechanisms without semantic conflict.
