       Using BGP Community for Inter-AS Security Policy Signaling
           draft-guo-idr-bgp-security-policy-community-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a set of standardized BGP communities to
   signal inter-AS routing security policy intent.  Current mechanisms
   like ROA [RFC6482] [RFC9582] and ASPA [ASPA-Profile]
   [ASPA-Verification] provide validation states, but leave "NotFound"
   or "Unknown" states ambiguous.  This document defines transitive
   communities that allow an Origin AS to explicitly signal its security
   requirements, such as strict enforcement of ROA and ASPA, to
   downstream Autonomous Systems (AS).  This mechanism provides
   downstream ASes with the explicit authorization to treat unvalidated
   routes as invalid, reducing the risk of accidental outages while
   improving hijack resilience.  Unlike validation states, these
   communities communicate the origin's security expectations (e.g.,
   ROA/ASPA strict enforcement) to all downstream ASes.  The document
   emphasizes the transitive nature of these signals to ensure end-to-
   end security policy coordination.  By enabling explicit signaling of
   security requirements, this mechanism allows downstream ASes to make
   informed decisions and enforce consistent policies, improving the
   overall security of inter-AS routing without risking accidental
   outages due to misinterpretation of validation states.

1.  Introduction

   Internet routing security relies on distributed validation mechanisms
   like RPKI [RFC6480], ROA [RFC6482] [RFC9582], and ASPA [ASPA-Profile]
   [ASPA-Verification].  However, there is a functional gap between
   "knowing a route's validity" and "knowing the origin's policy
   intent."

   It has following gaps: these security mechanisms are often locally
   enforced only.  No consistent method exists for an AS to signal its
   security requirements for propagated prefixes.  [SIDROPS-STATE]
   advises against carrying actual validation state in BGP.  This leaves
   downstream ASes with ambiguity.  For example, when a Transit AS
   observes an RPKI "NotFound" state, it cannot distinguish between an
   Origin AS that has not deployed RPKI and an Origin AS that has
   deployed RPKI but suffered a configuration error or a hijack attempt.

   This document introduces BGP Security Policy Communities to bridge
   these gaps.  These are signals that travel with the NLRI to inform
   every AS on the AS-PATH about the protection level applied to the
   prefix.  By signaling security policy intent, an Origin AS can
   explicitly inform the network that its prefixes MUST always satisfy
   specific security criteria.  For example, an Origin AS can signal
   that its prefixes MUST be rejected if they are not RPKI valid, even
   if the local RPKI check returns "NotFound".  This allows downstream
   ASes to make informed decisions and enforce security policies
   consistently, without risking accidental outages due to
   misinterpretation of validation states.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Policy Signaling and Transitivity

3.1.  Transitive Property Requirement

   All communities defined in this document MUST be transitive to ensure
   the security intent reaches the entire AS-PATH.

   *  Large Communities: This document will use large communities to
      carry the security policy sign of Origin AS.  As per [RFC8092],
      the Global Administrator field MUST contain the ASN of the Origin
      AS that set the policy.

   *  Propagation: Intermediate ASes SHOULD NOT strip these communities.
      If an AS modifies the AS-PATH (e.g., via AS-Prepend), it MUST
      maintain these communities.

4.  Protocol Operations

4.1.  Origin AS Behavior

   The Origin AS SHALL attach the appropriate Security Policy Community
   when advertising a prefix.  It MUST ensure that its published RPKI
   ROAs and ASPA objects are consistent with the signaled community to
   avoid self-inflicted DoS.  For example, an AS 65001 supporting strict
   RPKI-ROA filtering would attach:

   *  Large Community: 65001:1000:1 (ROA-Strict)

4.2.  Intermediate AS Behavior

   Intermediate ASes SHOULD preserve these communities.  If an
   Intermediate AS supports this specification, it MAY use these
   communities to automate its ingress/egress filtering policies.  An AS
   receiving a route with these communities MUST process them as
   follows:

   1.  Validation: The AS MUST verify that the Global Administrator ASN
       in the Large Community matches the Rightmost (Origin) AS in the
       AS-PATH.  If they do not match, the community MUST be ignored to
       prevent unauthorized policy signaling.

   2.  ROA-Strict Enforcement: If ROA-Strict is present and the local
       RPKI check returns NotFound or Invalid, the AS SHOULD treat the
       route as Invalid and apply its local filtering policy (typically
       dropping the route).

   3.  ASPA-Strict Enforcement: If ASPA-Strict is present and the ASPA
       validation state is Unknown or Invalid, the AS SHOULD reject the
       route.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Authenticity

   While communities are transitive, they are not cryptographically
   signed (unlike BGPsec).  An adversary could potentially attach or
   strip these communities.  Therefore, these communities SHOULD be
   treated as "Policy Recommendations" unless combined with BGPsec or
   other path validation mechanisms.  And these communities MUST NOT
   override a "Valid" RPKI state.  They serve as a "Strictness Toggle"
   for states that are otherwise ambiguous.

5.2.  Mitigation of DoS Risks

   By removing active "drop" commands, this document minimizes the risk
   of a malicious actor using these communities to trigger a network-
   wide outage.  The mandatory check against the Origin AS in the AS-
   PATH ensures that only the legitimate owner of the prefix (or someone
   who has successfully hijacked the entire path) can signal the policy.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines new BGP Community values for signaling security
   policy intent.  IANA is requested to create a sub-registry "BGP
   Security Policy Action IDs" under the "BGP Large Communities"
   registry.

   The format of these communities are Global-Administrator:Action-
   ID:Parameter.  The Global Administrator MUST be the ASN of the Origin
   AS.

        +===========+=============+==============================+
        | Action ID | Name        | Policy Intent Description    |
        +===========+=============+==============================+
        | 1000      | ROA-Strict  | Reject if RPKI state is      |
        |           |             | Invalid OR NotFound.         |
        +-----------+-------------+------------------------------+
        | 1001      | ASPA-Strict | Reject if ASPA validation    |
        |           |             | state is Invalid or Unknown. |
        +-----------+-------------+------------------------------+

                                 Table 1

6.1.  Standard Community Mapping (Legacy)

   For [RFC1997] support, the following values are assigned from the
   Well-Known range:

   *  65535:1000 (ROA-Strict)

   *  65535:1001 (ASPA-Strict)
