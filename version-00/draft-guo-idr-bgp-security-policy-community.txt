    Origin-Authorized Routing Policy Signaling Using BGP Communities
           draft-guo-idr-bgp-security-policy-community-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a set of standardized BGP communities to
   signal inter-AS routing security policy intent.  Current mechanisms
   like ROA [RFC6482] [RFC9582] and ASPA [ASPA-Profile]
   [ASPA-Verification] provide validation states, but leave "NotFound"
   or "Unknown" states ambiguous.  This document defines transitive
   communities that allow an Origin AS to explicitly signal its security
   requirements, such as strict enforcement of ROA and ASPA, to
   downstream Autonomous Systems (AS).  This mechanism provides
   downstream ASes with the explicit authorization to treat unvalidated
   routes as invalid, reducing the risk of accidental outages while
   improving hijack resilience.  Unlike validation states, these
   communities communicate the origin's security expectations (e.g.,
   ROA/ASPA strict enforcement) to all downstream ASes.  The document
   emphasizes the transitive nature of these signals to ensure end-to-
   end security policy coordination.  By enabling explicit signaling of
   security requirements, this mechanism allows downstream ASes to make
   informed decisions and enforce consistent policies, improving the
   overall security of inter-AS routing without risking accidental
   outages due to misinterpretation of validation states.

1.  Introduction

   Inter-domain routing security mechanisms intentionally separate
   validation from policy.  While this separation improves robustness,
   it also creates persistent operational ambiguity.

   Internet routing security relies on distributed validation mechanisms
   like RPKI [RFC6480], ROA [RFC6482] [RFC9582], and ASPA [ASPA-Profile]
   [ASPA-Verification].  However, there is a functional gap between
   "knowing a route's validity" and "knowing the origin's policy
   intent."

   These security mechanisms are often locally enforced only.  No
   consistent method exists for an AS to signal its security
   requirements for propagated prefixes.  [SIDROPS-STATE] advises
   against carrying actual validation state in BGP.  This leaves
   downstream ASes with ambiguity.  For example, when a Transit AS
   observes an RPKI "NotFound" state, it cannot distinguish between an
   Origin AS that has not deployed RPKI and an Origin AS that has
   deployed RPKI but suffered a configuration error or a hijack attempt.
   Theses mechanisms do not allow an Origin AS to express:

   *  whether it expects strict validation to be applied;

   *  whether certain propagation behaviors are explicitly authorized;

   *  and whether "NotFound" or "Unknown" outcomes are operationally
      acceptable.

   As a result, downstream networks frequently face situations where
   routing information is technically acceptable, yet operationally
   unexpected.  In large-scale deployments, this ambiguity leads to:

   *  inconsistent treatment of identical prefixes;

   *  reliance on bilateral or undocumented conventions;

   *  and difficulty distinguishing misconfiguration from malicious
      behavior.

   Existing uses of BGP communities partially address this gap, but lack
   standardized semantics and clear separation from validation state.

   This document addresses the need for a minimal, standardized
   mechanism to express origin-authorized security policy intent,
   without redefining or exporting validation outcomes.  It introduces
   BGP Security Policy Communities to bridge these gaps.  These are
   signals that travel with the NLRI to inform every AS on the AS-PATH
   about the protection level applied to the prefix.  By signaling
   security policy intent, an Origin AS can explicitly inform the
   network that its prefixes MUST always satisfy specific security
   criteria.  For example, an Origin AS can signal that its prefixes
   MUST be rejected if they are not RPKI valid, even if the local RPKI
   check returns "NotFound".  This allows downstream ASes to make
   informed decisions and enforce security policies consistently,
   without risking accidental outages due to misinterpretation of
   validation states.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Policy Signaling and Transitivity

3.1.  Transitive Property Requirement

   All communities defined in this document MUST be transitive to ensure
   the security intent reaches the entire AS-PATH.

   *  Large Communities: This document will use large communities to
      carry the security policy sign of Origin AS.  As per [RFC8092],
      the Global Administrator field MUST contain the ASN of the Origin
      AS that set the policy.

   *  Propagation: Intermediate ASes SHOULD NOT strip these communities.
      If an AS modifies the AS-PATH (e.g., via AS-Prepend), it MUST
      maintain these communities.

3.2.  Policy Signaling Versus Validation State

   This document makes a strict distinction between:

   *  validation state, which is derived locally from cryptographic or
      registry-based mechanisms; and

   *  policy intent, which reflects the Origin AS’s operational
      expectations.

   The communities defined herein exclusively signal policy intent.
   They do not encode validation outcomes, confidence levels, or
   security posture of any AS other than the origin.

   Downstream ASes MUST NOT interpret these communities as an indication
   that validation has been successfully performed, nor as a substitute
   for local validation.

   This design explicitly aligns with the guidance in [SIDROPS-STATE],
   and avoids propagating dynamic security state within BGP.

4.  Protocol Operations

4.1.  Architecture Overview

   The mechanism defined in this document operates entirely within the
   BGP control plane and does not alter protocol message formats or path
   selection procedures.

   An Origin AS attaches one or more security policy communities when
   originating a route.  These communities are propagated unchanged
   unless explicitly removed by policy.

   Intermediate and receiving ASes may choose to:

   *  ignore the communities;

   *  log or monitor their presence;

   *  correlate them with local validation results;

   *  and incorporate them into local policy decisions.

   No mandatory processing behavior is defined, and no interoperability
   dependency is introduced.

4.2.  Origin AS Behavior

   The Origin AS SHALL attach the appropriate Security Policy Community
   when advertising a prefix.  It MUST ensure that its published RPKI
   ROAs and ASPA objects are consistent with the signaled community to
   avoid self-inflicted DoS.  For example, an AS 65001 supporting strict
   RPKI-ROA filtering would attach: "Large Community: 65001:1000:1 (ROA-
   Strict)"

4.3.  Intermediate AS Behavior

   Intermediate ASes SHOULD preserve these communities.  If an
   Intermediate AS supports this specification, it MAY use these
   communities to automate its ingress/egress filtering policies.  An AS
   receiving a route with these communities MUST process them as
   follows:

   1.  Validation: The AS MUST verify that the Global Administrator ASN
       in the Large Community matches the Rightmost (Origin) AS in the
       AS-PATH.  If they do not match, the community MUST be ignored to
       prevent unauthorized policy signaling.

   2.  ROA-Strict Enforcement: If ROA-Strict is present and the local
       RPKI check returns NotFound or Invalid, the AS SHOULD treat the
       route as Invalid and apply its local filtering policy (typically
       dropping the route).

   3.  ASPA-Strict Enforcement: If ASPA-Strict is present and the ASPA
       validation state is Unknown or Invalid, the AS SHOULD reject the
       route.

4.4.  Applicability to Route Leak and Hijack Detection

   Security policy communities may serve as additional context for
   routing analysis systems.

   For example, a route that violates an origin-authorized export
   constraint, while also exhibiting abnormal AS path patterns, may be
   flagged as anomalous with higher confidence.

   Such signals can reduce false positives in detection systems by
   providing operator-declared intent, without asserting correctness.
   This document does not define detection algorithms or mitigation
   procedures.

4.5.  Deployment Considerations

   The proposed mechanism is compatible with existing routing policies
   and does not require changes to BGP implementations.  Deployment of
   this mechanism is expected to be incremental and partial.

   The proposed mechanism is intended for gradual deployment and
   interoperability with existing BGP technologies.  Origin ASes may
   selectively signal policy intent for specific prefixes.  In hybrid
   networks where both supporting and non-supporting ASes are present,
   policy communities will simply be ignored by legacy BGP speakers,
   providing backward compatibility.  No coordination between ASes is
   required.

   For environments supporting both Standard [RFC1997] and Large
   [RFC8092] Communities, implementations SHOULD attach both
   representations to maximize backward compatibility.  Operators are
   encouraged to monitor for loss or modification of policy communities
   due to intermediate ASes that filter or rewrite BGP Community
   attributes so as to ensure policy expectations are properly signaled
   end-to-end.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Authenticity

   These communities provide no security guarantees and MUST NOT be used
   as a basis for accepting otherwise invalid routes.

   While communities are transitive, they are not cryptographically
   signed (unlike BGPsec).  An adversary could potentially attach or
   strip these communities.  Therefore, these communities SHOULD be
   treated as "Policy Recommendations" unless combined with BGPsec or
   other path validation mechanisms.  And these communities MUST NOT
   override a "Valid" RPKI state.  They serve as a "Strictness Toggle"
   for states that are otherwise ambiguous.

5.2.  Mitigation of DoS Risks

   By removing active "drop" commands, this document minimizes the risk
   of a malicious actor using these communities to trigger a network-
   wide outage.  The mandatory check against the Origin AS in the AS-
   PATH ensures that only the legitimate owner of the prefix (or someone
   who has successfully hijacked the entire path) can signal the policy.

5.3.  Threat Model and Abuse Considerations

   The communities defined in this document are not cryptographically
   protected.  An adversary capable of hijacking a prefix may also
   attach, modify, or remove communities.

   Therefore, these communities MUST NOT be treated as authoritative
   proof of security properties.

   Potential abuse scenarios include:

   *  false signaling of strict security requirements;

   *  removal of policy signals during propagation;

   *  inconsistent signaling across multiple origin points.

   These risks are consistent with existing uses of BGP communities and
   do not introduce new attack vectors.  Operators SHOULD treat these
   signals as advisory inputs and correlate them with independently
   verifiable information.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines new BGP Community values for signaling security
   policy intent.  IANA is requested to create a sub-registry "BGP
   Security Policy Action IDs" under the "BGP Large Communities"
   registry.

   The format of these communities are Global-Administrator:Action-
   ID:Parameter.  The Global Administrator MUST be the ASN of the Origin
   AS.

   Action ID |   Name      | Policy Intent Description
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1000     |  ROA-Strict | Reject if RPKI state is Invalid OR NotFound.
    1001     | ASPA-Strict | Reject if ASPA validation state is Invalid or Unknown.

6.1.  Standard Community Mapping (Legacy)

   For [RFC1997] support, the following values are assigned from the
   Well-Known range:

   *  65535:1000 (ROA-Strict)

   *  65535:1001 (ASPA-Strict)

Appendix A.  Parameter Field Extensibility

   The "Parameter" field in the BGP Security Policy Community is
   explicitly designed for extensibility.  Currently, a value of "1"
   conveys default strict enforcement for security actions (e.g., ROA-
   Strict or ASPA-Strict).  Future assignments may introduce further
   parameters to support nuanced policy signaling, such as variant
   filtering levels, time-limited policies, or security requirements
   specific to more recent routing security enhancements.

   Example encodings:

   *  65001:1000:1 (ROA-Strict, default strict enforcement)

   *  65001:1000:2 (ROA-Strict, but only for prefixes with maxLength
      constraints, a future possible assignment)

   *  65001:1002:1 (hypothetical new Action-ID for a future policy,
      e.g., “AS-Cones Strict”)

   The Action-ID and Parameter range is managed through IANA for orderly
   growth as the community adopts richer security policies.
